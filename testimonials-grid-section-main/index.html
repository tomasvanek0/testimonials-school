      <p class="text">Verified Graduate</p>
      <h3 class="secondary-heading">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br> were current, if not more so,
        in the company I joined. I<br> honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</h3>
      <p class="text">‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a<br>
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
        for<br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
        The next 12<br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
        the course, I‚Äôve<br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

      <p class="text">‚Äú I started as a total newbie with<br> virtually no coding skills. I now work<br> as a mobile engineer
        for a big<br> company. This was one of the best<br> investments I‚Äôve made in myself. ‚Äù</p>

      <h3 class="secondary-heading">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp<br> themselves. Getting guidance from them and
        learning from<br> their experiences was easy.</h3>
      <p class="text">‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The<br> program
        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present<br> myself as a capable
        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the<br> personal attention you need from

    <h3 class="secondary-heading2">Such a life-changing<br> experience. Highly<br> recommended!
    </h3>
    <p class="text2">‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
      professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
      student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
      did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
      project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
      could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
      experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
      100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
